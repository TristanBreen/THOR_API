# PNES Detection Quick Reference

## What You're Seeing

The PNES Detection Analysis section on your dashboard helps identify whether seizures are more likely psychological (PNES) or neurological (epilepsy).

## The Score (0-100)

- **50+** 🔴 HIGH PNES Risk - Psychological factors likely significant
- **30-49** 🟠 MODERATE - Mixed indicators, requires further evaluation  
- **15-29** 🟡 LOW - Primarily neurological patterns
- **0-14** 🟢 MINIMAL - Strong epileptic seizure indicators

## What Increases PNES Score?

✓ High correlation between pain/stress and seizures  
✓ Most seizures happen during day (7 AM - 11 PM)  
✓ Highly variable seizure durations  
✓ Seizures triggered by specific situations  
✓ Low connection to menstrual cycle  

## What Decreases PNES Score?

✓ Few seizures with associated pain/stress  
✓ Many seizures at night (during sleep)  
✓ Very consistent seizure durations  
✓ Random seizure triggers  
✓ Clear menstrual cycle pattern  

## Risk Factors Explained

Each risk factor shows:
- **Score**: How strong this pattern is (%)
- **Description**: What the data shows
- **PNES Relevance**: Why it matters for PNES diagnosis

## Clinical Recommendations

Based on your score, you'll see specific recommendations:

**HIGH PNES Risk** → Consider evaluation by neuropsychiatrist  
**MODERATE** → Psychological screening recommended  
**LOW/MINIMAL** → Continue standard epilepsy management  

## Important: This Is Not a Diagnosis

⚠️ This tool screens for PNES patterns but is NOT a diagnosis.  
A doctor or specialist must:
- Review your medical history
- Perform EEG monitoring
- Assess psychological factors
- Make the final diagnosis

## Using This Information

1. **Share with your doctor** - Print or screenshot results
2. **Track triggers** - Note emotional, environmental, or stress-related patterns
3. **Monitor trends** - Check if score changes over time
4. **Consider next steps** - Discuss EEG monitoring or psychological evaluation if HIGH PNES risk
5. **Don't stop medications** - Continue any prescribed treatments unless directed otherwise

## Red Flags (Seek Medical Attention)

- Sudden change in seizure patterns
- New or worsening symptoms
- Difficulty with medications
- Any medical emergency

## What Affects Your PNES Score?

### Your Input Data Helps The Calculation:

✓ Seizure dates and times  
✓ Seizure duration  
✓ Food intake information  
✓ Menstrual period tracking  
✓ Pain/stress documentation  

### More Detailed Tracking = Better Results

Keep accurate records of:
- When seizures occur (date, time, duration)
- What you were doing when it happened
- Stress level before seizure
- Any pain or anxiety that day
- Whether you ate food recently
- Menstrual cycle status

## Common Questions

**Q: Does a HIGH score mean I have PNES?**  
A: No. It means your pattern has features common in PNES. Only a doctor can diagnose.

**Q: Can my score change?**  
A: Yes. As you track more data and patterns emerge, your score will update.

**Q: What if my score is LOW but I think it's PNES?**  
A: Low scores suggest epilepsy patterns, but PNES can occur with any seizure-like symptoms. Discuss with your doctor.

**Q: Should I stop my seizure medication?**  
A: No. Never stop without medical guidance, regardless of your PNES score.

**Q: How is this different from an EEG?**  
A: This analyzes patterns in your seizure data. EEG directly measures brain activity. Both can help with diagnosis.

## Next Steps

1. ✅ **Track carefully** - Accurate data makes analysis better
2. ✅ **Share results with doctor** - Bring this to your next appointment
3. ✅ **Get EEG if recommended** - Can confirm or rule out epilepsy
4. ✅ **Consider psychology evaluation** - If recommended
5. ✅ **Continue treatment** - Follow your doctor's plan
