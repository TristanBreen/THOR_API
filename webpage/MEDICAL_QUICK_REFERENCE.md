# Medical Insights - Quick Reference for Clinicians

## At a Glance Summary

| Metric | What It Means | Action If High | Action If Low |
|--------|---------------|----------------|---------------|
| **Food Impact** | Seizures with food vs without | Dietary triggers → Elimination diet | Food protective → Encourage eating |
| **Period Impact** | Seizures during vs outside cycle | Catamenial epilepsy → Hormonal therapy | Random pattern → Genetic/organic focus |
| **Pain Correlation** | Pain days = Seizure days? | PNES likely → Psych evaluation | Organic seizures → Standard epilepsy care |
| **Interval Avg** | Time between seizures | <24h = Refractory → Med adjustment | >30d = Controlled → Continue therapy |
| **Duration Trend** | Are seizures getting longer/shorter? | Increasing = Worsening → Review meds | Decreasing = Improving → Continue |
| **Duration Variability** | Are seizures consistent? | High CV = PNES likely → Psych eval | Low CV = Epilepsy likely → EEG focus |

## Key Thresholds & Interpretations

### Food Impact
- **>40 sec difference** = Clinically significant trigger/protector
- **>60% seizures with food** = Strong food trigger pattern
- **>20 sec difference** = Notable but may be random variation
- **<10 sec difference** = Likely not clinically significant

### Menstrual Correlation
- **>3:1 ratio** (period:non-period seizures) = Catamenial pattern → HRT evaluation
- **70%+ period seizures** = Strong hormonal influence → Perimenstrual prophylaxis
- **25-30% period seizures** = Expected rate for cyclical disorders
- **<20% period seizures** = Minimal hormonal influence

### Pain-Seizure Correlation
- **>75% correlation** = Probable PNES/psychogenic component
- **50-75% correlation** = Mixed etiology (epilepsy + stress)
- **25-50% correlation** = Weak pain-seizure link
- **<25% correlation** = Pain likely incidental

### Inter-Seizure Intervals
- **Avg <12h** = Cluster seizures/refractory, urgent med adjustment
- **Avg 12h-7d** = Active epilepsy, monitor closely
- **Avg 7-30d** = Adequate control, continue current therapy
- **Avg >30d** = Excellent control, consider dose reduction

### Duration Variability (Coefficient of Variation)
- **>100%** = Highly inconsistent → PNES workup
- **50-100%** = Variable → Mixed epilepsy/PNES possible
- **20-50%** = Moderate consistency → Typical epilepsy
- **<20%** = Highly consistent → Pure epilepsy pattern

## Clinical Decision Tree

```
START: Review Medical Insights

┌─ Food Avg Difference >40 sec?
│  ├─ YES → Consider food elimination trial → Dietary consult
│  └─ NO → Food unlikely major trigger
│
├─ Period Seizures >70%?
│  ├─ YES → Probable catamenial epilepsy → Hormone panel + Psych
│  │        → Consider perimenstrual prophylaxis
│  └─ NO → Random or non-hormonal pattern
│
├─ Pain-Seizure Correlation >75%?
│  ├─ YES → PNES likely → Psychiatric evaluation URGENT
│  │        → Video-EEG monitoring recommended
│  │        → Reduce/hold some anti-seizure meds
│  └─ NO → Organic seizures more likely
│
├─ Avg Interval <24h?
│  ├─ YES → Refractory epilepsy → Med level check → Adjust dose
│  │        → Consider combo therapy or new agent
│  └─ NO → Adequate inter-seizure spacing
│
└─ Duration Trend Increasing?
   ├─ YES → Medication may be failing → Level check/adjust
   │        → Order routine EEG
   │        → Assess compliance
   └─ NO → Seizures stable/improving → Continue current plan

## Common Patterns & What To Do

### Pattern 1: Food Trigger + High Pain Correlation
**Interpretation**: Likely PNES triggered by anticipatory food anxiety
**Action**: 
1. Psychiatric evaluation for anxiety, trauma
2. Video-EEG (may show non-epileptic activity)
3. Dietary reassurance/counseling
4. Consider reducing anti-seizure meds

---

### Pattern 2: Clear Catamenial + Normal Pain
**Interpretation**: Hormonal epilepsy, not psychogenic
**Action**:
1. Hormone panel (estradiol, progesterone levels)
2. Refer to reproductive endocrinology
3. Trial of perimenstrual prophylaxis (extra medication 3 days before/during/after period)
4. Consider oral contraceptives (if appropriate for patient)

---

### Pattern 3: Low Food Impact + Low Pain + Increasing Duration + Short Intervals
**Interpretation**: Worsening generalized epilepsy
**Action**:
1. STAT: Check anti-seizure medication levels
2. Order routine EEG
3. Assess medication compliance
4. Consider medication increase or add second agent
5. Rule out secondary causes (infection, metabolic, tumor)

---

### Pattern 4: Long Intervals + Decreasing Duration Trend
**Interpretation**: Current therapy likely effective
**Action**:
1. Continue current medication regimen
2. Reinforce compliance
3. Assess lifestyle changes (stress reduction, sleep improvement)
4. Monthly follow-up to ensure trend continues

---

### Pattern 5: Highly Variable Intervals + High Duration CV + High Pain Correlation
**Interpretation**: PNES highly likely
**Action**:
1. Priority psychiatric referral
2. Video-EEG monitoring (diagnostic)
3. Counseling about PNES (explain non-epileptic nature)
4. Gradual medication reduction under supervision
5. Psychological therapy initiation

## Questions to Ask Patient After Reviewing Insights

### Food-Related
- "Have you noticed seizures happen more after eating certain foods?"
- "Do you worry about food causing seizures?"
- "Any GI symptoms (nausea, reflux) before seizures?"

### Period-Related
- "Do seizures cluster around your period?"
- "Any pattern based on your cycle?"
- "Worse stress/anxiety at certain times of month?"

### Pain-Related
- "When do you experience pain - just before, during, or after seizures?"
- "What situations trigger both pain AND seizures?"
- "Any triggers like stress, arguments, or emotional events?"

### Interval-Related
- "Can you predict when seizures might occur?"
- "Do they seem to come in clusters (multiple close together)?"
- "Any weeks/months completely seizure-free?"

## Red Flags & When to Escalate

🚨 **Immediate Action Needed**:
- Seizures increasing in frequency (interval avg shortening)
- Duration rapidly increasing (upward trend >20% in month)
- Clusters forming (multiple per day)
- New pattern emergence (was random, now predictable)

📋 **Urgent Referral**:
- High pain correlation + normal pain days = PNES likely → Psych
- Clear catamenial pattern + uncontrolled = Reproductive endo
- Refractory pattern (avg <12h) = Epilepsy specialist

⚠️ **Routine But Important**:
- Food trigger identified = Nutritionist consult
- Moderate pattern changes = Continue monitoring
- Stable chronic pattern = Annual reassessment

---

## Medication Adjustments Based on Insights

### If Interval Average Decreasing
- Check drug level (therapeutic vs subtherapeutic)
- If subtherapeutic → Increase dose
- If therapeutic but worsening → Consider:
  - Add second agent
  - Switch to different medication
  - Rule out medical triggers

### If Duration Trend Increasing
- Same as above (medication likely insufficient)
- Also assess: compliance, absorption, drug interactions

### If Pain Correlation High (>75%)
- Do NOT just increase antiepileptic drugs
- May want to reduce redundant medications
- Psychiatric meds may be more appropriate than seizure meds
- Gradual tapering with psych team

### If Catamenial Pattern
- Increase dose during high-risk days (perimenstrual prophylaxis)
- Consider hormonal contraceptives (if appropriate)
- Schedule appointments around seizure-high times
- Warn about driving risk during period
